    <td><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This simulation shows you how a violin string’s  mass, tension, and length affect the pitch of its fundamental and harmonic vibrations. You can adjust the string’s characteristics and then play the string to see  the shape of its vibration.<br>
      </P>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Begin by choosing which string  to play. The violin  has four strings, each with a different mass.  Those masses range from 0.1 g (0.1 gram or 0.0001 kg) for the E5 string up to 0.8 g for the G3 string. The masses of  real violin strings are typically close to these values.<br>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Next choose the string’s tension, which can range from  0.01  to 999.99 N (newtons). Real strings have tensions of roughly 50 to 100  N. A real string with 0.01 N of tension would be much too loose to play and a  real string with more than about 200 N would either snap or damage the violin’s  neck. Nonetheless, you can try unrealistic tensions if you so desire.<br>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Now choose the string’s length. You may choose any value  between the string’s full length of 328 mm (328 mm or 0.328 meters) and its  minimum length of 100 mm when you press it against the end of the fingerboard. These values are typical for real violins.<br>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Your last choice is whether to observe the string’s  fundamental vibrational mode, its second harmonic mode, or its third harmonic  mode. In most cases, the sound you hear from a real violin is primarily its  fundamental vibrational mode. This simulation, however, lets you observe the  harmonic vibrations by themselves.<br>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Once you have adjusted the violin, press the “Play” button  to observe the string’s vibration. Since the actual vibration would be too  rapid to see, the simulation slows it down to a reasonable speed. The actual  pitch and frequency of the string’s vibration is displayed at the bottom of the  simulation.<br>
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When you’re ready to readjust the violin, press the “Play”  button again to stop it from vibrating. You can then change the settings and  play the string again. </p>
